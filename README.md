# Computational Tools for Aural Skills Pedagogy  

This repository contains materials for a WIP article on how tools from computational musicology can help provide a common framework for aural skills instructors to assess difficulty on melodic dictation research.
Material for this article originally appeared in David John Baker's PhD dissertation, chapter 4. 

Here you will find the following:

* Text of pre-print in `document/computational_tools_for_aural_skills_pedagogy.pdf`
* Data collected for survey in `data/survey.csv`
* Melodies used in `data/melodies/` in ``**kern`` format
* Meta-data for sample of melodies in `data/subset_metadata.csv`
* Scripts used to generate plots in `scripts`
* Shiny app?? 

## To Do 

* [ ] Create papaja document / rproj 
* [ ] Sketch outline of paper  
* [ ] Import data used in MMD chapter  
* [ ] Import scripts used in MMD chapter  
* [ ] Re-create paths used for this repo, not mmd 
* [ ] Import bibs for writing 
* [ ] Insert images in paths  

# Done
